            <p class="sub-title">You reconnect with nature in the most intimate and powerful way by becoming aware of your breathing, and learning to hold your attention there, this is a healing and deeply empowering thing to do. It brings about a shift in consciousness, from the conceptual world of thought, to the inner realm of unconditioned consciousness</p>

                    <p><span class="drop-cap">J</span>ust a walk in the woods or a stroll by the beach on a sunny morning can awaken the innermost feelings of <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a27115824/peace-quotes/">happiness and peace</a>, and Environmental Psychology has gone a long way proving this fact (Bell, Greene, Fisher, & Baum, 1996). Our affinity toward nature is genetic and deep-rooted in evolution. Research reveals that environments can increase or reduce our stress, which in turn <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/body">impacts our bodies.</a> What you are seeing, hearing, experiencing at any moment is changing not only your mood, but how your nervous, endocrine, and immune systems are working.</p>
                    <p>The stress of an unpleasant environment can cause you to feel anxious, or sad, or helpless. This in turn elevates your <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings">blood pressure,</a> heart rate, and muscle tension and suppresses your immune system. A <a href="https://thesector.com.au/2019/05/20/the-importance-of-environmental-aesthetics-to-educator-and-child-wellbeing/">pleasing environment</a> reverses that. And regardless of age or culture, humans find nature pleasing. In one study cited in the book Healing Gardens, researchers found that more than two-thirds of people choose a natural setting to retreat to when stressed. </p>

                    <h2>Positive effects Of  Connecting with Nature</h2>

                    <p>Author Richard Louv mentioned ‘Nature-Deficit Disorder’ in his famous book ‘Last Child In The Woods.’ According to Louv, <a href="http://richardlouv.com/blog/what-is-nature-deficit-disorder">nature-deficit disorder</a> is not the presence of an anomaly in the brain; it is the loss of connection of humans to their natural environment. Staying close to nature improves physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. It makes us feel alive from the inside, and we should not compromise it for recent developments like urbanization, technology, or social media.
                    </p> 
                    <p>As mentioned above, the <a href="https://selecthealth.org/blog/2019/07/10-reasons-why-being-in-nature-is-good-for-you">benefits of staying close to nature</a> are diverse. We can enjoy the positive effects of connecting to the environment at all levels of individual well-being. Let’s see how:</p>  
                    
                    <h3>Nature Impacts Health</h3>
                    
                    <ul class="indented">
                        <li><h4>Nature Heals</h4></li>
                        <p>Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. It may even reduce mortality, according to scientists such as public health researchers Stamatakis and Mitchell.</p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Nature Soothes</h4></li>
                        <p>In addition, nature helps us cope with pain. Because we are genetically programmed to find trees, plants, water, and other nature elements engrossing, we are absorbed by nature scenes and distracted from our pain and discomfort. This is nicely demonstrated in a now classic study of patients who underwent gallbladder surgery; half had a view of trees and half had a view of a wall. </p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Nature Restores</h4></li>
                        <p>One of the most intriguing areas of current research is the impact of nature on general wellbeing. In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after spending time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. Other studies by Ulrich, Kim, and Cervinka show that time in nature or scenes of nature are associated with a positive mood, and psychological wellbeing, meaningfulness, and vitality</p>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Spiritual Enhancement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Breathing in nature gives us wholesome sensory awareness. When we spend time outdoors, we are more mindful of what we see, what we hear, what we smell, and what we feel.</li>
                        <li>By staying close to nature, we feel more grateful and appreciative of what it has to offer to us (Proshansky, 1976). </li>
                        <li>Nature has the ability to be imbued with spiritual power and significance. Forests, lakes, and mountains often invoke a feeling of the divine or inspire a sense of awe.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Research On Connecting Children With Nature</h2>
                    <p>The research ‘Benefits Of Connecting Children With Nature’ (New Zealand Department of Conservation, n.d.) was an authentic initiative to support environmental conservation and <a href="https://environment.co/6-ways-to-raise-awareness-about-environmental-issues/">increase nature awareness</a> among youngsters today. The study explores the reasons for the disconnect that the young generation is unconsciously suffering from and suggests effective approaches that can help in improving the nature-human reciprocity.
                        The researchers mentioned about the quote by Maria Montessari:</p>
                    
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <blockquote class="box-design">
                            “Let the children be free; encourage them;
                            let them run outside when it is raining;
                            let them remove their shoes when they find a puddle of water;
                            and when the grass of the meadows is wet with dew,
                            let them run on it and trample it with their bare feet;
                            let them rest peacefully when a tree invites them to sleep beneath its shade;
                            let them shout and laugh when the sun wakes them in the morning.”
                        </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Importance of Nature to Well-Being</h2>
                    <p>A 30-days campaign was run by the Wildlife Trusts of the University of Derby, with the prime focus on uncovering the crucial role nature plays in our overall eudaemonia. The study revealed that subjective <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/affects-of-joy">feelings of happiness</a> and wellbeing were positively correlated with natural activities such as gardening, animal feeding, bird watching, and bushwalking (Richardson, Cormack, McRobert, & Underhill, 2016).</p>
                    <p>Dr. Miles Richardson, the face of this research, cited valuable evidence on how proximity to the nature improved mood, enhanced respiratory functioning, regulated <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321486#symptoms">hormonal malfunctions,</a> and impacted on the thought structure of individuals as a whole. Just by being outdoors and using all our senses to appreciate nature, we can be more mindful of the present, gain emotional resilience, and combat stress with more vitality.</p>
                    <p>We become <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune">naturally immune to anxiety,</a> emotional ups and downs, and thought blocks, thereby feel more lively and energetic than before.The survey further pointed that people who lived close to <a href="https://www.philosophytalk.org/shows/nature-wilderness">natural wilderness</a> like the beach, mountains, or parklands, had better mental health and reported of falling sick lesser than those living in congested urban settings. Such families had fewer instances of domestic violence, said of feeling less fatigued, and showed increased productivity at the professional front.</p>

                        <dt>A Take Home Message</dt>
                        <dd>Staying close to nature, observing all the little and significant elements of it, and appreciating it from the very core, is therapeutic and self-healing.
                        Even by saying and doing nothing, we can learn so much from connecting to our natural surroundings. It gives us the perspective for healthier living, the motivation to carry on, and the energy to keep trying. For there is no bond more primitive and ingrained in us than our love for nature and nature’s care for us.</dd>
